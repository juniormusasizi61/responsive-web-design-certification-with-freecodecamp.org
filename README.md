#with this responsive web design certification, i focus too much on html basics and css basics for simple web design 
#i build a cat photo app to learn the basics of html and css 
#later i shall learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin and the best accessibility by building a quiz site 
#finally i learn how to make web pages that respond to different screen sizes by building a photo gallery with flexbox and a magazine article layout with CSS Grid.

#**some browser extensions such as ad-blockers and dark mode extensions can interfere with the tests on freecodecamp. incase the yare faced, a recommendation to disable extensions that modify the content or layout of the pages while taking the course.**
